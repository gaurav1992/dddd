		<h2>Privacy policy</h2>
		<p style="padding-top:10px;" class="">DeziNow collects information about you when you use our mobile applications, websites, and other online products and services (collectively, the “Services”) and through other interactions and communications you have with us. This Privacy Statement applies to information collected and used by DeziNow (DeziNow referred to herein collectively as “DeziNow” or “we”). Please review this privacy policy periodically as we may revise it without notice. This privacy policy was last revised on September 15 , 2016. Each time you use DeziNow or provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy at that time..

		<h4>Data We Collect From You</h4>

		<p>When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:</p>
		
		<p><strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services:</strong> We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register for access to the Services or use certain Services. Wherever DeziNow collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.</p>
		
		<p>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of DeziNow and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.</p>

		<h4>Other Information:</h4>

		<p><strong>Non-Identifiable Data:</strong> When you interact with DeziNow through the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. DeziNow may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by DeziNow affiliates, agents or service providers. The Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.</p>
		
		<p>In operating the Services, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data, except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service features.</p>
		
		<p>In addition, we may use “Flash cookies” to better operate the Services. Flash cookies are local shared objects used to display content based upon what you view on our site. Flash cookies personalize your visit, but are different from the browser cookies discussed above, because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, click here.</p>
		
		<p>We may also use technologies called “web beacons”, which communicate information from your Internet browser to a web server. Web beacons can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, and allow a web server to read certain types of information from your browser, including whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the web beacon, the IP address of your computer and the URL of the webpage from which the web beacon was viewed. For example, a visit www.DeziNow.com that is routed from a banner ad on another web site will be recognized in order to understand the effectiveness of the ad. We and our partners use web beacons for a variety of purposes, including analyzing the use of our Services and, in conjunction with cookies, providing content and ads more relevant to you.</p>
		
		<p>In some instances, we may use embedded scripts that recognize a unique identifier from a cookie placed on your hard drive by another website. These are used by us solely to gauge the success of our own advertising. For instance, we may use a script to determine whether you visit our pages after visiting a site where DeziNow appeared in a news article. We do not use these scripts to gather information on your use of the internet unrelated to DeziNow, nor do we use them to identify your personal information.
		</p>
	
		<p><strong>Aggregated Personal Data:</strong> In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, DeziNow often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and DeziNow may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. DeziNow may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Location Information:</strong> Our Service may collect and use your location information (for example, by using the GPS on your mobile device) to provide certain functionality of our Service. If you choose to enable our location features, your location information may be publicly displayed within the Service. Please keep in mind that other users can see this information about you, and they may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities outside of our control and without your knowledge. Your location information may be subject to abuse, misuse, and monitoring by others, so please be careful if you choose to enable location functionality. We may also use your location information in an aggregate way, as described above in the “Aggregated Personal Data” section.</p>
	
		<h4>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h4>

		<p>DeziNow uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. DeziNow and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Related Companies”) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our users and to improve the Services. DeziNow and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.</p>
		
		<p>If DeziNow intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.</p>
	
		<h4>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h4>

There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:</p>
		
		<p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.</p>
		
		<p>Related Companies: We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
		
		<p>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: DeziNow, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.</p>

This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to DeziNow through the Services or through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Services, such as forums, any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, “Unsolicited Information”).

		<h4>Links to Other Web Sites:</h4>

		<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by DeziNow (the “Third Party Sites”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Services do not imply that DeziNow endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.</p>

		<h4>Integrating Social Networking Services:</h4>

		<p>The Service allows you to enable or log in to the Services via various social networking services like Facebook or Twitter (“Social Networking Service(s)”). By directly integrating these services, we make your online experiences richer and more personalized. To take advantage of this feature, we will ask you to log into or grant us permission via the relevant Social Networking Service. When you add a Social Networking Services account to the Service or log into the Service using your Social Networking Services account, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable the Service to access that Social Networking Service and your data contained within that Social Networking Service. As part of such integration, the Social Networking Service will provide us with access to certain information that you have provided to the Social Networking Service, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, please remember that the manner in which Social Networking Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of such third parties, and DeziNow shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Social Networking Services that may be enabled within the Service.</p>
	
		<p>You may also have the option of posting your Services activities to Social Networking Services when you access content through the Services (for example, you may post to Facebook that you performed an activity on the Service); you acknowledge that if you choose to use this feature, your friends, followers and subscribers on any Social Networking Services you have enabled will be able to view such activity.</p>

		<h4>Security:</h4>

		<p>DeziNow takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the Services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to DeziNow via the Internet.</p>
