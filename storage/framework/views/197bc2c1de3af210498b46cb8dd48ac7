    <h2>DeziNow</h2>
    <p class="mtop-30">We wanted to create a system for those people whose options are limited when they go out for a night out in the town and drive to their 
locations. Some people do not feel comfortable leaving their cars at the location and taking a taxi or other ride services back. 
So they take a risk and drive even after drinking. However, we want to provide another 
simple and cost effective option and get people home safely. </p>
